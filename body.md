### Welcome to ikelab.
We, Information & Knowledge Engineering (ike) lab., research and develop methodologies and applications of handling information and knowledge in order to analyze, model, and improve a variety of systems of industrial engineering in effective ways. Currently, our research focuses majorly on the container terminal operations and management. Our immediate goal is to reproduce the operations of container terminals in the world as the form of computer simulation by use of stom, our discrete-event simulation system. We pay our efforts on proposing a framework of modeling the planning and control logic in unified way for covering various types of terminal operations and equipment, and also on implementing the basic logic based on the framework in order for our simulation to work. Eventually, we will present a container terminal simulator, which is fused with terminal operating systems, for analyzing, modeling, and improving the container terminal operations and management.
